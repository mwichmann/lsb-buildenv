	   Looks like we also need -I{C++ include path}/backward, at least
	   to compile Celestia.  gcc includes this directory and the

	* lsbcc.c
	   Don't recognize -v. Just let is pass thorugh as an unreognized

	* lsbcc.c
	   Make sure -lgcc_s (if needed) and -lgcc are on the link line
	   both before and after -lc, to match how gcc/g++ do it. Intends
	   to eliminate things like __divdi3@@GLIBC_2.0 from appearing as
	   undefined and needing to be satisfied by glibc. Note that gcc
	   3.2 also add -lgcc_eh on the link line if not in g++ mode;
	   that's not reflected here since there is no gcc_eh on pre-3.x
	   compilers.

2002-11-16	Mats Wichmann <mats.d.wichmann_at_intel.com>

	   System paths were being examined before user-specified paths;

2002-06-11	Stuart Anderson <anderson_at_freestandards.org>
	* lsbcc.c
	   Since we turn off all std libs, we also need to put libgcc at

	   helper functions such as __cmpdi3.

2002-06-10	Stuart Anderson <anderson_at_freestandards.org>
	* lsbcc.c
	   It probably is useful to have libc_nonshared.a, but specify it
	   using -l instead of the absolute path of the file. This lets gcc
	   handle things right when no files are specified on the command
	   line.

2002-06-07	Stuart Anderson <anderson_at_freestandards.org>
	* lsbcc.c
	   Don't put /usr/lib/libc_nonshared.a at the end of the command
	   being passed to gcc.  This solves the problem where imake blows
	   up when it calls "lsbcc -". It apprears that the couple of
	   things in here are in the shared libc anyway.

2002-06-06	Stuart Anderson <anderson_at_freestandards.org>
	* lsbcc.c
	   Oops, left libz out of the list of LSB libraries

2002-05-30	Stuart Anderson <anderson_at_freestandards.org>
	* lsbcc.c
	   The idea was to include /usr/lib/libc.a _After_ everything else
	   to try and catch any function that otherwise would just not be
	   available. It turns out that this doesn't work because it can
	   cause too much stuff to be pulled into the final executable, and
	   you end up with a hybrid static/shared file that crashes before
	   main().

2002-05-21	Stuart Anderson <anderson_at_freestandards.org>

	   Make an arg 'const'

2002-05-20	Stuart Anderson <anderson_at_freestandards.org>
	* lsbcc.c
	   1) libm is an LSB library, so don't force it to be static 2)
	   Recognize -L options so that -L/usr/lsb/lib ends up being at the

	   3) Recognize the "-shared" option and don't specify the system
	   libraries, etc    if it's found.

	   The shell script ran out of steam so this is a reimplementation
	   in C. This fixes most of the problems the shell script was
	   having, and has the added advantage of giving me the opportunity
	   to write up the documentation for this. I'm still running this
	   through the tests/app battery, but so far it seems to be
	   behaving fine, and handles configure scripts will. I will be
	   makign another pass through, adding some env variable mechanism
	   to turn on some debugging, once I finish deciding what might be
	   interesting to see.

	   The time has finally arrived to make lsbcc smarter. I hope this
	   doesn't get out of hand.  Recognize options that prohibit
