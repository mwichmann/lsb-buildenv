This is the compiler front-end tool for the LSB SDK.

It munches the command line to produce something suitable for passing to
the back-end compiler, normally gcc, although there's at least nominal
support for Intel's icc compiler.

This tool is only interesting in the presence of LSB SDK headers and
build-time libraries ("stub libraries"). While the normal situation is
to put LSB SDK materials in /opt/lsb, the default in this directory
(set in the Makefile) is to build as if files were going in /usr/local,
normal for most pieces of add-on software. If experimenting with lsbcc
to debug an environment that's already installed, the usual path options
can be used, for example:

    INSTALL_ROOT=/opt/lsb make
