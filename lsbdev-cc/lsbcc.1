.TH lsbcc "1" "" "lsbcc (LSB)" LSB
.SH NAME
lsbcc, lsbc++ \- compiler driver for building LSB conforming applications
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsbcc
.RI [ compiler-options ]
.br
.B lsbc++
.RI [ compiler-options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This tool should be used in place of the
.I cc
(or
.IR c++ )
command when
building an LSB-conforming program.
.P
The LSB development environment provides
a set of replacement system headers and 
stub dynamic libraries.
These headers and libraries have been
carefully built so that they contain only the interfaces
specified in the LSB. 
.P
LSB programs also need to be linked with 
a special program interpreter which identifies
them as LSB conforming.
.P
.I lsbcc
is designed to take care of these build issues 
(to the extent possible) without requiring changes
to existing build setups. 
.P
.IR lsbcc
takes no options; 
it first modifies the command line to follow the
LSB build rules, then passes the resulting
command line on to the regular compiler.
.P
Behavior other than the default is controlled
by a set of environment variables.
.P
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the behavior of
.I lsbcc
.TP
LSBCC_DEBUG
A numeric value which represents a bit pattern specifying what
kinds of debugging output to produce. The bits in this pattern are
.nf

0x0001   Display enviromental overrides
0x0002   Display the arguments passed in
0x0004   Display the arguments that are specifically recognized
0x0008   Display the arguments that are not recognized
0x0010   Display changes made to the include arguments
0x0020   Display changes made to the library arguments
0x0040   Display the modified argument list
.fi
.TP
LSBCC_WARN
A numeric value which represents a bit pattern specifying what
kinds of warnings to emit. The bits in this pattern are
.nf

0x0001   Warn about libraries being changed to static linking
.fi
.TP
LSBCC
Specifies the name of the C compiler to invoke with the modifed
argument set. If this environment variable is not found,
the default 
.I cc
will be used.
.TP
LSBCXX
Specifies the name of the C++ compiler to invoke with the modifed
argument set. If this environment variable is not found,
the default 
.I c++
will be used.
.P
.TP
LSBCC_LIBS
Specifies the location of the LSB stub libraries that will
be linked against.  If this environment variable is not found,
the default 
.I /opt/lsbdev-base/lib
will be used.
.P
.TP
LSBCC_INCLUDES
Specifies the location of the LSB header files that will
be linked against.  If this environment variable is not found,
the default 
.I /opt/lsbdev-base/include
will be used.
.P
.TP
LSBCXX_INCLUDES
Specifies the location of the LSB C++ header files that will
be linked against.  If this environment variable is not found,
the default 
.I /opt/lsbdev-base/include/c++
will be used.
.P
.TP
LSBCC_SHAREDLIBS
A library name or colon-separated list of library names to
add to the default list. The name should be the base part
of the library only, for example to add
.I libfoo.so
use the name
.IR foo .
.IP
Normally, only LSB-defined libraries should be linked
as shared libraries, all others are to be linked statically.
However, if an application provides its own shared library
which has been carefully checked for LSB conformance, this
method can be used to turn off
.IR lsbcc 's
rule of forcing static linking. The application may not depend
on such a library being present on a system, so it must either
be shipped with the application, or with another LSB conforming
application on which this application depends.

.SH "BUGS"
.P
It is a little too easy to confuse lsbcc (and lsbc++). 
In particular, build systems that include "clever" tools
to manage which libraries to use, such as GNU libtool
and pkgconfig, may defeat the checks for non-LSB libraries.
.SH FILES
.TP
/opt/lsbdev-base/include
the LSB header files
.TP
/opt/lsbdev-base/lib
the LSB stub libraries
.TP
ld-lsb.so.1
The LSB program interpreter (dynamic linker) for IA32.
This value will be different on other architectures.
.TP
ld-lsb-ia64.so.1
The LSB program interpreter for the Itanium architecture

.P
.SH NOTES
.P
.I lsbcc
is commonly delivered as a package named
.IR lsb-build-cc .
If this package is used, the support package
.I lsb-build-base
must also be installed.
.P
.I lsb-build-c++
supplies necessary header files for C++ compilation.
.P
For commercial applications, developers need to be aware of the
licenses of the libraries they link to. Since some licenses
allow dynamic but not static linking to the library, and
.I lsbcc
may silently change (apparent) dynamic links to static, the
.B LSBCC_WARN
envirnonment variable should be used to notify of such changes.
