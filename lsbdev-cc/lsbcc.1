.TH lsbcc "1" "" "lsbcc (LSB)" LSB
.SH NAME
lsbcc \- compiler driver for building LSB conforming applications
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsbcc
.RI [ compiler-options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This tool should be used in place of the
.I cc
(or
.IR c++ )
command when
building an LSB-conforming program.
.P
The LSB development environment provides
a set of headers and libraries nominally found in
.I /opt/lsbdev-base/include
and
.I /opt/lsdev-base/lib
respectively. These headers and libraries have been
carefully built so that they contain only the interfaces
provided by the LSB. 
.P
LSB programs also need to be linked with 
.I ld-lsb.so.1
.RI ( ld-lsb-ia64.so.1
for the Itanium architecture)
as the program intepreter.   
.P
.IR lsbcc
is designed to take care of these build issues 
(to the extent possible) without requiring changes
to existing build setups. It takes no options; 
the rest of the command line will be passed on to the
regular compiler.
.IR lsbcc
first modifies the command line to follow the
LSB build rules.
.P
.SS Invocation Examples
.B "lsbcc hello.c -o hello"
.P
.B "make CC=lsbcc"
.P
.B "CC=lsbcc CXX=lsbc++ ./configure; make"

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the behavior of
.IR lsbcc
.TP
LSBCC_DEBUG
This is a numeric value which represents a bit pattern that specifies what
kind of debugging output to produce. The bits in this pattern are
.nf

0x0001   Display enviromental overrides
0x0002   Display the arguments passed in
0x0004   Display the arguments that are specifically recognized
0x0008   Display the arguments that are not recognized
0x0010   Display changes made to the include arguments
0x0020   Display changes made to the library arguments
0x0040   Display the modified argument list
.fi
.TP
LSBCC
This specifies the name of the C compiler to invoke with the modifed
argument set.
.TP
LSBCXX
This specifies the name of the C++ compiler to invoke with the modifed
argument set.

.SH "BUGS"
.P
It is a little too easy to confuse lsbcc (and lsbc++). 
In particular, build systems that include "clever" tools
to manage which libraries to use, such as GNU libtool
and pkgconfig, may defeat the checks for non-LSB libraries.
