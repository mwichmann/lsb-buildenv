NAME

     sys/types.h - data types

SYNOPSIS

     #include <sys/types.h>

DESCRIPTION

     The <sys/types.h> header includes definitions for at least the
     following types:

     blkcnt_t
          Used for file block counts

     blksize_t
          Used for block sizes

     clock_t
          Used for system times in clock ticks or CLOCKS_PER_SEC (see
          <time.h>).

     clockid_t
          Used for clock ID type in the clock and timer functions.

     dev_t
          Used for device IDs.

     fsblkcnt_t
          Used for file system block counts

     fsfilcnt_t
          Used for file system file counts

     gid_t
          Used for group IDs.

     id_t Used as a general identifier; can be used to contain at least
          a pid_t, uid_t or a gid_t.

     ino_t
          Used for file serial numbers.

     key_t
          Used for interprocess communication.

     mode_t
          Used for some file attributes.

     nlink_t
          Used for link counts.

     off_t
          Used for file sizes.

     pid_t
          Used for process IDs and process group IDs.

     pthread_attr_t
          Used to identify a thread attribute object.

     pthread_cond_t
          Used for condition variables.

     pthread_condattr_t
          Used to identify a condition attribute object.

     pthread_key_t
          Used for thread-specific data keys.

     pthread_mutex_t
          Used for mutexes.

     pthread_mutexattr_t
          Used to identify a mutex attribute object.

     pthread_once_t
          Used for dynamic package initialisation.

     pthread_rwlock_t
          Used for read-write locks.

     pthread_rwlockattr_t
          Used for read-write lock attributes.

     pthread_t
          Used to identify a thread.

     size_t
          Used for sizes of objects.

     ssize_t
          Used for a count of bytes or an error indication.

     suseconds_t
          Used for time in microseconds

     time_t
          Used for time in seconds.

     timer_t
          Used for timer ID returned by timer_create().

     uid_t
          Used for user IDs.

     useconds_t
          Used for time in microseconds.

     All of the types are defined as arithmetic types of an appropriate
     length, with the following exceptions: key_t, pthread_attr_t,
     pthread_cond_t, pthread_condattr_t, pthread_key_t,
     pthread_mutex_t, pthread_mutexattr_t, pthread_once_t,
     pthread_rwlock_t and pthread_rwlockattr_t. Additionally, blkcnt_t
     and off_t are  extended signed integral types, fsblkcnt_t,
     fsfilcnt_t and ino_t are defined as  extended unsigned integral
     types, size_t is an unsigned integral type, and blksize_t, pid_t
     and ssize_t are signed integral types. The type ssize_t is capable
     of storing values at least in the range [-1, SSIZE_MAX].  The type
     useconds_t is an unsigned integral type capable of storing values
     at least in the range [0, 1,000,000]. The type suseconds_t is a
     signed integral type capable of storing values at least in the
     range [-1, 1,000,000].

     There are no defined comparison or assignment operators for the
     types pthread_attr_t, pthread_cond_t, pthread_condattr_t,
     pthread_mutex_t, pthread_mutexattr_t, pthread_rwlock_t and
     pthread_rwlockattr_t.
