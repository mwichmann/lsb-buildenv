NAME

     stddef.h - standard type definitions

SYNOPSIS

     #include <stddef.h>

DESCRIPTION

     The <stddef.h> header defines the following:

     NULL  Null pointer constant.

     offsetof(type, member-designator)

          Integral constant expression of type size_t, the value of
          which is the offset in bytes to the structure member
          (member-designator), from the beginning of its structure
          (type).

     The <stddef.h> header defines through typedef:

     ptrdiff_t
          Signed integral type of the result of subtracting two
          pointers.

     wchar_t
          Integral type whose range of values can represent distinct
          wide-character codes for all members of the largest character
          set specified among the locales supported by the compilation
          environment: the null character has the code value 0 and each
          member of the Portable Character Set has a code value equal
          to its value when used as the lone character in an integer
          character constant.

     size_t
          Unsigned integral type of the result of the sizeof operator.

APPLICATION USAGE

     None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

     None.
