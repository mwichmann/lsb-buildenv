This directory contains the code capable of generating stub libraries
for a LSB compliant build environment. 

Building the stub libraries
---------------------------

If you have done a CVS update then the files generated for IA32
against a recent version of the specification will be present in the
directory. If you want to build for a different architecture or ensure
that you are building it for the latest version of the specification
then you will have to have access to the LSB database (see details in
the dbdump directory of the data module on Source Forge) and generate
the files from the database.

To compile the stub libraries simply type make.

Generating the necessary files from the LSB database
----------------------------------------------------

1. Depending on how you have configured your local LSB database you
may need to edit the dbfiles Makefile target to pass the appropriate
user, password and database name parameters.

2. Clean out any existing files
# make distclean

3. Generate the database files
# make dbfiles
