This directory contains the code capable of generating stub libraries
for a LSB compliant build environment. 

Building the stub libraries
---------------------------

To compile the stub libraries simply type make.

Generating the necessary files from the LSB database
----------------------------------------------------

1. Depending on how you have configured your local LSB database you
may need to edit the dbfiles Makefile target to pass the appropriate
user, password and database name parameters.

2. Clean out any existing files
# make distclean

3. Generate the database files
# make dbfiles
