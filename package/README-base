LSB Base Build Environment
=====================

The package contains the following:

  - LSB stub libraries (stub_libs). 
    These libraries contain the versioned symbols as required by
    the LSB specification. Linking against these libraries will ensure
    that the application attempts to use the correct versions 
    at runtime. They do not contain the code necessary for
    a program to operate during runtime.

  - LSB Header files
