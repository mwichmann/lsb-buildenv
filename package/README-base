LSB Base Build Environment
=====================

The package contains the following:

  - LSB stub libraries (stub_libs), base portion.
    These libraries contain the versioned symbols as required by the LSB
    specification. Linking against these libraries helps ensure that
    the application references the correct set of symbols and symbol
    versions at runtime.  They do not contain the code necessary for a
    program to operate during runtime.

  - LSB Header files matching the stubs in this package
    Note that these headers are generated from the LSB database based
    on elements captured as necessary.  As a result they are not likely
    to be as "complete" as the native headers, and in some cases may
    have a different structure - the chain of inclusion should satisfy
    the standard's claim "visbile when this header is included" but
    may not match the exact file native headers place things in. Please
    report issues using the information below.
