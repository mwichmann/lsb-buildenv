LSB Application Runner
======================

This package contains lsbrun, a simple utility which can mimic an LSB
environment for LSB-compliant applications on systems which do not
provide an LSB runtime environment.

Please note that lsbrun is not a miracle worker.  It can only allow an
application to run if the system is mostly LSB-compliant, and is only
missing the LSB dynamic linker.  It cannot emulate missing libraries
or API calls, or correct incorrect behavior.

Usage
-----

The lsbrun utility acts as a helper for LSB-compliant apps, setting up
the environment to compensate for a missing LSB dynamic linker.  You
can run it in this way by just running "lsbrun <app>".

It can also install itself as a transparent shim around an LSB app.
Run it as "lsbrun --check <app>", and it will check for an LSB
environment.  If it finds one, lsbrun will simply exit.  If not, it
will move the original app binary and copy itself in its place.  From
then on, running the original binary's path will invoke lsbrun
transparently.
