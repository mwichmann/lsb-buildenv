LSB Build Environment
=====================

This purpose of this package is to make it easier to build LSB
compliant applications. It is not meant to necessarily provide an LSB
runtime environment and is possible/easy to build a binary in the
build environment which will not actually run in it. Use the LSB
sample implementation to test the binaries and packages.

See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to install the build
environment.

Quickstart
----------
Configuration file: /etc/lsbdev/lsbdev.conf

Starting:
# /etc/init.d/lsbdev start

Stopping:
# /etc/init.d/lsbdev stop

Using the environment
---------------------
This build environment should be considered EXPERIMENTAL. Ensure that
you understand how bind-mounts work before removing files in the build
environment. Depending on which version of the kernel you are using
read-only bind mounts may not in fact be read only, so it is possible
to accidentally remove important files outside of the chroot area from
within it.  The purpose of the chroot area is not for reasons of
security, but instead to make it easier to build applications without
accidentally polluting binaries with information from non-compliant
header files and libraries (as can easily happen with configure
scripts).

A developer can build an application within this build environment by
first chrooting into the directory structure constructed by the setup
scripts. This environment by default provides tools installed in /bin
and /usr/bin and the core runtime libraries needed to compile and link
a binary. As there currently are not a set of known LSB compliant
header files available the header files of the system are used.
Although a complete set of development tools will not be available
through just /bin and /usr/bin more may be included by individually
bind mounting them into the chroot area.

If the package is configured to use sshd, an sshd running inside the
chroot area will be started listening on a high port (5436 by
default). This allows non root privileged users to enter the
environment (without using chroot).

The package contains the following:

  - LSB stub libraries (stub_libs). 
    These libraries contain the versioned symbols as required by
    the LSB specification. Linking against these libraries will ensure
    that the application attempts to use the correct versions 
    at runtime. They do not contain the code necessary for
    a program to operate during runtime.

  - gcc spec file
    A modified version for gcc (2.95.4). This will ensure that the programs
    are linked against ld-lsb.so.1 instead of ls-linux.so.2. It also
    adds the lsb stub library directory to the link search path. 

  - rpm binaries
    A statically linked version of rpm and associated binaries/scripts
    and other infrastructure needed to package applications. You might
    not need this if you have a version of rpm capable of generating
    v3 format packages on your system.

  - setup scripts
    scripts to setup the chroot build environment

Known Bugs
----------

- No tested LSB compliant header files available yet. /usr/include
  from system used in place which may not be completely compliant.
